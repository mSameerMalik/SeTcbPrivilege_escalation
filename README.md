# TcbElevation

**TcbElevation** is a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) tool demonstrating **Local Privilege Escalation (LPE)** on Windows systems where the current user possesses **SeTcbPrivilege** (`Act as part of the operating system`).  
The tool abuses **SSPI hooking** to impersonate the **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM** LUID and gain a fully privileged handle to the **Service Control Manager (SCM)**, allowing execution of arbitrary commands as **SYSTEM** via a temporary service.

> ⚠️ **Educational PoC** — Intended strictly for authorized security research and lab environments.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **SeTcbPrivilege Enablement**  
  Automatically enables `SeTcbPrivilege` in the process token.

- **SSPI Hooking**  
  Hooks authentication routines to spoof the caller LUID.

- **SYSTEM Impersonation**  
  Uses the SYSTEM LUID (`0x3E7`) during `OpenSCManager` calls.

- **SCM Access**  
  Obtains full permissions on the Service Control Manager.

- **Command Execution**  
  Executes arbitrary commands as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

## 📷 Proof of Concept

A user with `SeTcbPrivilege` is normally denied when attempting administrative actions such as adding local users.  
`TcbElevation.exe` bypasses this restriction and successfully performs the action as **SYSTEM**.
